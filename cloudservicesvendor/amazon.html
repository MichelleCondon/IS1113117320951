        <h1 class="h1">Infrastructure as a service</h1>
        <!--adding a paragraph-->
        <p>Infrastructure as a Service is hardware that is provided by an external provider and managed for you.
        it provides access to computing resource in a virtualised environment, the Cloud, across a public connection,
        usually the internet. With IaaS, however, the client is given access to virtualised components in order to build their own IT platforms.
        The computing resource provided is specifically that of virtualised hardware, in other words, computing infrastructure. The definition 
        includes such offerings as virtual server space, network connections, bandwidth, IP addresses and load balancers.</p>
        <h2>Benefits include:</h2>
        <!--ordered lists-->
        <li>Scalability</li>
        <li>No hardware CAPEX</li>
        <li>Physical security of the data centre location</li>
        <li>Utility style costing</li>
        <li>Location independence</li>
        <!--paragraphs-->
        <p>IaaS helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered 
        as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it. The cloud computing service provider manages the infrastructure,
        while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own software-operating systems, middleware, and applications.</p>
        <p>Common Scenarios:</p>
