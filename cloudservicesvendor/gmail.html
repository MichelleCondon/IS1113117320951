        <!--paragraphs-->
        <p>Communications as a service (CaaS) is a collection of different vendor services that facilitate business communications.
        Organizations may use these and similar services to lower costs and increase efficiency for business processes involving audio or video telecommunications
        It is also an alternative to the traditional model of buying and installing licensed software on site.</p>
        <br>
        <!--paragraphs-->
       <p>The core concept of CaaS is that accessing these services over the internet is extremely convenient. The client businesses do not have to worry about maintaining
        servers and connections, uploading different kinds of content or doing all of the administrative work involved in keeping a communications platform functional.
        Businesses have designed specific video conferencing products in which users can sign via the Internet and participate as necessary. Vendors can then bill the business
        according to its participation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is part of a greater trend toward cloud computing services and other remote services used by businesses to reduce overhead or optimize business processes.</p>
