        <h3>What you need to know about cloud services</h3>
        <p>A cloud service is any service made available to users on demand via the Internet from a cloud computing provider's servers as opposed to
        being provided from a company's own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services,
        and are fully managed by a cloud services provider.</p>
        <p>Whether you are running applications that share photos to millions of mobile users or you're supporting the critical operations of your business, a cloud 
        services platform provides rapid access to flexible and low cost IT resources. With cloud computing, you don't need to make large upfront investments in hardware and 
        spend a lot of time on the heavy lifting of managing that hardware. Instead, you can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need to power
        your newest bright idea or operate your IT department. You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly, and only pay for what you use.</p>
