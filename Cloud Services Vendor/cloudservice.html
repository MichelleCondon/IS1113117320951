        Software as a service is a way of delivering centrally hosted applications over the Internet—as a service. SaaS applications are sometimes 
        called web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS provider’s servers. Instead of installing
        complicated and time consuming software it can be accessed via the internet.
