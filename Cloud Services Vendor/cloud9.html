        <h1 class="h1">Platform as a service</h1>
        <p>PaaS provides a framework for quickly developing and deploying applications by automating infrastructure provisioning and management. Cloud 9 is the
        best example of this. PaaS is rapidly growing particularly amongst developers as a way to code test and deploy their applications instead of dealing with
        hardware-oriented tasks such as managing security patches and operating system updates. In addition to the managed infrastructure, PaaS products include APIs and 
        tools that enable developers to use features such as traffic splitting, monitoring, and version control systems.

        <p>Technical advantages of PaaS:</p>
        <li>Expertise</li>
        <li>Speed</li>
        <li>Cost</li>
        <li>Scale</li>
        <p>PaaS allows quick and efficient app development as the developer is no longer responsible for installing the hardware and software and
        maintaining the system. PaaS cuts development costs as theres no need to build anything before the developer begins.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Advantages of Platform as a Service</p>
        <li>Easy to maintain</li>
        <li>Easy integration with current systems</li>
        <li>Real time information</li>
        <li>Shared Insights</li>
